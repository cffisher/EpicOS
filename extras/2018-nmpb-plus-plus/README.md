# NMPB++
NMPB++ was a Node.js MIDI player for [Multiplayer Piano](https://multiplayerpiano.net) inspired by [Ste-Art's MIDI player bot (NMPB)](https://nmpb-blog.blogspot.com/).
It started off by simply splittingIt was able to connect clients via proxies and split MIDI notes between them to bypass the website's note limit. 
It featured a web controller of some description, which might've been my first time trying to create any kind of website.
It's published here in its tacked-together glory for archival purposes. Recovered from a CD-RW 2023.12.08.

NMPB++ started off as a bot that simply split the notes of the original NMPB (running in a private channel), and later evolved into a stand-alone Node.js MIDI bot using midi-player-js.
