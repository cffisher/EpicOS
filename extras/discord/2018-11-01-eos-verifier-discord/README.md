# Epic's Discord Server Verification Bot

This is a pretty barebones Node.js [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot from 2018. Recovered from a CD-RW on 2023.12.08. Published for archival purposes.
It welcomed users to a Discord server and assigned them bot/user roles.
I have:
- Standardized tab spaces.
- Removed secrets (user ids, role ids and bot tokens, etc.)

Other than that, the original (bad) code structure remains.
