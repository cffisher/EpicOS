# EpicOS 2021

This is a 2021 Node.js version of EpicOS for Multiplayer Piano published for archival purposes.

It supports multiple instances and features a MIDI player. Most of this code was replaced or updated by 2023 in a new version.

It also features attempts at bot identification and afk detection from before MultiplayerPiano.net added tags to bots and tags to afk users.

You might notice that the related messages are commented out as they became pretty annoying.
The main app.js was archived & replaced while commands continued to be used & updated, so this is the only archived file.

No commands are included.
