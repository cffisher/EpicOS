# nmpb-plus-plus for Multiplayer Piano
NMPB++ was a Node.js MIDI player for Multiplayer Piano inspired by Ste-Art's NMPB.
It was able to connect clients via proxies and split MIDI notes between them to bypass the website's note limit. 
It featured a web controller of some description, which might've been my first time trying to create any kind of website.
It's published here in its tacked-together glory for archival purposes.
